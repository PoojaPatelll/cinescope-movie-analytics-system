## 📌 Overview
CineScope is a real-time movie analytics and data pipeline system that fetches real-time data from the TMDB API, stores it in a MySQL database, and updates automatically on a daily basis. The system is designed to handle duplicates, maintain clean data, and support relational queries.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was built to simulate a real-world data pipeline where movie data is continuously fetched, processed, and stored for analysis.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔄 Fetches real-time trending movies using TMDB API  
- ⏰ Automated daily database updates using Task Scheduler  
- 🗄️ MySQL database integration  
- 🔗 Relational database design with foreign key constraints  
- 📋 Watchlist feature to track movies   
- 🧠 SQL queries for data analysis (joins, aggregations, trends)  
- ⚠️ Error handling and retry mechanism for API failures

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies:  pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set your API key using environment variables:
   export TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key
4. Run the script:
   python src/fetch_movies.py

Note: API key is stored securely using environment variables.

## ▶️ Sample Run Output


## 📊 Database Design
- Movies table stores movie details  
- Watchlist table stores user-tracked content  
- Foreign key relationship ensures data consistency

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. Python script fetches trending movies from TMDB API  
2. Data is processed and duplicates are handled  
3. Clean data is stored in MySQL database  
4. Watchlist is linked using foreign keys  
5. SQL queries generate insights  
6. Task Scheduler automates daily execution
